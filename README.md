# Blockchain-Based Healthcare Provider Network Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for healthcare provider network management, creating a transparent, secure, and efficient system for verifying medical professionals, managing insurance network participation, standardizing payment terms, and tracking healthcare outcomes. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the platform reduces administrative burden, enhances data integrity, improves payment processes, and increases trust among all healthcare stakeholders.

## Key Components

### Provider Verification Contract
Validates credentials of medical professionals through a decentralized verification system that confirms education, licensure, certifications, and practice history. The contract creates a trusted digital identity for healthcare providers that eliminates redundant credentialing processes and ensures up-to-date qualification status.

### Network Participation Contract
Manages provider inclusion in insurance networks through smart contracts that codify participation agreements, specialties, locations, and patient acceptance policies. The system creates a single source of truth for network status, reducing directory errors and simplifying updates when provider information changes.

### Service Rate Contract
Defines agreed payment terms for medical procedures through transparent, cryptographically secured contracts between providers and payers. The system standardizes coding, bundling rules, and reimbursement rates, creating immutable records of payment agreements that reduce billing disputes.

### Performance Tracking Contract
Monitors quality metrics and healthcare outcomes through a privacy-preserving ledger that records patient outcomes, satisfaction scores, and quality measures. The system enables performance-based contracting while maintaining compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.
